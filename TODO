# TODO LIST

- Confusion Matrix (f1 score)
- Visualization (plots) (Validation Plot, ROC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve), is the model overfitting?

- 5 fold cross validation (mean and std)
- Feature Importance (if applicable) (important features for Parkinsons)

- Balance datasets (50-50 split)

- Feature extractions algorithms used (if applicable) for sound wav files:
  - MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
  - Chroma Feature
  - Mel Spectrogram
  - Zero Crossing Rate
  - Spectral Contrast
  - Tonnetz

Add more feature extractions -> future importance (for parkinson detection) -> to the best overall accuracy algorithm

- Deliverables:
  - Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations
  - README file with instructions on how to run the code
  - Report summarizing findings, model performance

We want to compare our results with assets/PD_SPEECH_FEATURES.csv dataset for Parkinson's detection. (from kaggle)

Decide which features are more important for Parkinson's detection based on your analysis and the comparison with the provided dataset.
